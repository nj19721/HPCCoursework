This directory was included to demonstrate the non-vectorised serial code. I was not sure if this was needed to check it met the serial times stated in the report so I included it just in case.

To compile and run, make sure

module load icc/2017.1.132-GCC-5.4.0-2.26

has been executed. Then simply type 'make'.
